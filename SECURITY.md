# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only provide security updates for the most recent Akari release. The
`release-please` workflow updates the table below each time a new version is
published so that it always reflects the currently supported release line.

| Version | Status |
| ------- | ------ |
| <!-- x-release-please-version -->v1.2.0 | ✅ Active |

All earlier releases are considered end-of-life and do not receive security
fixes. Upgrade to the latest version to remain supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report potential vulnerabilities by opening a GitHub issue in this repository.
Include as much detail as possible so we can reproduce and triage the problem.
We aim to acknowledge new reports within two business days and will keep you
informed as we validate, prioritize, and remediate the issue.

If you believe you have discovered a highly sensitive vulnerability that needs
real-time coordination, send a direct message on Bluesky to
[@imlunahey.com](https://bsky.app/profile/imlunahey.com) in addition to filing
the issue.
